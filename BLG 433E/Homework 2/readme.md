This simulation program simulates a TCP communication. To run this program you need to create a virtual environment, install the required packages in ``requirements.txt`` then run the ``run.py`` in the virtual environment.

There will be 3 columns of information, left one shows the sequence diagram, middle one shows the tcp events and right one shows the performance metrics.
